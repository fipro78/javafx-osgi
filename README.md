# Re-package OpenJFX as OSGi bundles

This repository shows how to use Tycho and the PDE Maven Locations in the Target Definition to repackage the org.openjfx jars to OSGi bundles.

The resulting bundles can be used in Eclipse like any other bundle (e.g. Import-Package) without the need to install e(fx)clipse in the IDE.
